-Add point system. Marking as been there grants been there points. Higher points
 grant higher teirs (iron, bronze, silver, gold, plat, diamond, etc.)

-Change formatting of localStorage to work with points system and to easier
 manipulate data.

 -Make each item clickable to show more information. Address and phone for quick
  call / directions.

-Do more research and implement react hooks. Focus on clean functional components.
 Keep everything scalable.

-Keep style simple, but interesting. Responsive but leaning more towards mobile.
